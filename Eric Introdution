Hi everyone, My name is hQin Xia and you can call me Eric.
This is my second year in Econ Graduate program. For my first year here, I've taken Data mining, Python and big data, causal inference and time series classes. And I think taking these classes helps me to build a data science system.
I'm currently learning how to preform complete data analysis. Looking forward to working with you guys.
