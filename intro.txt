Hello, my name is Annie. 
I am familiar with coding in Python, R, and SQL. I recently learned how to create Power BI dashboards and also manipulate data through Power Query.
I am somewhat familiar with machine learning methods from my data mining class, but I am interested in furthering my understanding by putting 
what I've learn to practice.

In terms of project interests, I have done many Econ and Data Projects on women's issues.
I have done one project looking at maternal mortality, and
I've done a project that look at how education levels affect women's representation in parliamentary positions around the world
and another specifically looking at how education level affect women's represenation in state legislatures in the US.

Overall, I'm just looking to expand/build existing skills and find tangible applications.
